# Healthcare-App

## Branching structure
### Building the core application will be done in the main branch. This includes functionalities such as the basic shell prompt as well as an authentication system. In order to implement the different use cases, a new branch will be used. This will allow me to easily identify if adding one feature breaks another one. Branches will be closed using pull requests when features are fully implemented to ensure cleanliness of the repo.
